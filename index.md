I was able to predict the arrival of COVID-19 to the local community of the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. I used tourist visitation and current coronavirus data to estimate various scenarios on the probability that the virus would reach the islands. My results concluded that a complete stop of incoming tourist flights would be the only way to delay arrival and reduce the curve. A complete lock-down of tourist travel to the islands was implemented within weeks of sharing my results—a decision that likely saved lives.

Here's a tool I built with Anna Calle (Charles Darwin Foundation) to make ecological restoration through adaptive management more efficient and cost-effective. Users will encounter features to facilitate every step of the restoration process, from planting and monitoring, to evaluating the progress toward restoration targets.

## How to compare two ecosystems

By comparing the biodiversity and composition of two ecosystems we can better understand the factors that differentiate these ecosystems in the first place. In this publication, I compared the plants and soils of two islands in the Gulf of Maine using simple visualizations, tables, and multivariate ordination.

## Are personality archetypes real?

In 2013, students of a statistics class at FSEV UK, Slovakia were asked to invite their friends to participate in a survey consisting of questions related to everything from fears, to hobbies, spending habits, and personality traits. I built a proof-of-concept Shiny App where you can see for yourself how a simple k-means cluster analysis can yield some interesting results with applications towards market segmentation.

## Can plant movement drive ecosystem function?

Here I used Bayesian regression, ordination, and model selection to see if island isolation can affect what types of plants make it to isolated Maine coast islands. This was the first empirical study to show that plant movement (or the lack there of) can influence patterns of plant traits on islands.

## Can you use genetic algorithms to beat the stock market?

<center><img src="/images/stock_thumb.png"></center>
I used a combination of cross-correlation, linear and logistic regression, and Bayesian approaches, along with a genetic algorithm for attempting to optimize a successful stock prediction algorithm.
