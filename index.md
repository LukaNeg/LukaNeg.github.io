## Comparing two ecosystems

<center><img src="/images/Duck_islands_thumb.png"></center>
By comparing the biodiversity and composition of two ecosystems we can better understand the factors that differentiate these ecosystems in the first place. In this publication, I compared the plants and soils of two islands in the Gulf of Maine using simple visualizations, tables, and multivariate ordination. <br>

## Can plant movement drive ecosystem function?

<center><img src="/images/Islands_Regression_thumb.png"></center>
Here I used Bayesian regression, ordination, and model selection to see if island isolation can affect what types of plants make it to isolated Maine coast islands. This was the first empirical study to show that plant movement (or the lack there of) can influence patterns of plant traits on islands.
